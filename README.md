# Stable Horde for Web UI
Stable Horde client for AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion Web UI

## How to use it

**To prevent loading the local models, add `--ui-debug-mode` to `COMMANDLINE_ARGS`**.

1. If you [registered an account](https://stablehorde.net/register), go to the `Stable Horde Settings` tab and set your `API key`. Leaving the default value will connect anonymously, which is limited.
2. Go to either the `txt2img` or the `img2img` tab and select `Run on Stable Horde` in the `Script` option. Without this option, it will run locally.
3. Set all parameters, both regular and Stable Horde's, and click `Generate`.
